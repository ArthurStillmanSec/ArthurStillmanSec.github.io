### IT Operations & Security Focus

> "Security is about vigilance, not just software."

I am an IT professional dedicated to the defense of physical and digital infrastructure. With a background in operations management and technical support, I approach technology with a focus on system integrity and operational readiness.

My strength lies in understanding the machinery that powers the network. I focus on hardware configuration, threat monitoring, and the strict protocols that keep environments secure. While others build the applications, I ensure the systems they run on are locked down, resilient, and always monitored.
