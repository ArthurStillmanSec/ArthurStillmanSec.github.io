I am an IT professional transitioning into Network Defense, leveraging over a decade of operational management experience to specialize in **Supply Chain Security** and **Physical Infrastructure Protection**.

Unlike traditional candidates, I possess a deep understanding of the logistical and physical layers of business operations. I bridge the gap between "Process" and "Protocol," ensuring that security measures are not just theoretical, but operational. My focus is on hardware hardening, threat monitoring, and maintaining the integrity of chain-of-custody environments.
