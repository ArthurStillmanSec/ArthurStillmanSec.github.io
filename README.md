### Cyber Security & IT Operations

> "Security is about vigilance, not just software."

I am an IT professional dedicated to the defense of physical and digital infrastructure. With a background in operations management and technical support, I approach security with a focus on system integrity and operational readiness.

My strength lies in understanding the machinery that powers the network. I focus on hardware configuration, threat monitoring, and the strict protocols that keep environments secure. While others build the applications, I ensure the systems they run on are locked down, resilient, and always monitored.

Currently completing my degree in Cyber Security at **Indian River State College**, I am looking to bring my "always-on-guard" mindset to a team that values reliability and unwavering attention to detail.
